            <p>Karibu to the Renaissance Party – a bold movement born from the heart of Kenya, driven by the call for constitutional integrity, truth, and justice. We are here to champion a new dawn for our nation, where the rule of law is not just a slogan but a lived reality for every Kenyan.</p>
            <p>At the Renaissance Party, we believe that a thriving democracy starts with a system that works for all, not just a few. We are committed to ensuring that justice is blind – no matter your status, influence, or connections, the law must apply equally. We stand firm against corruption, impunity, and the erosion of our constitutional values, because Kenya deserves leaders who serve the people, not themselves.</p>

    <div class="leader-message">
        <img src="./images/Billy.jpg" alt="Party Leader" class="leader-image">
        <p>It is with a deep sense of pride and responsibility that I address you today as the leader of The Renaissance Party. Our party stands as a beacon of hope, driven by unwavering values of truth, integrity, justice, and a firm commitment to upholding our Constitution. In a time when the very soul of our nation is at a crossroads, The Renaissance Party is here to chart a new course; one that leads to a better, more just, and prosperous Kenya for all.</p>
        <p>Our vision is rooted in the belief that a strong and vibrant nation is built upon the foundations of transparency, accountability, and inclusivity. The Renaissance Party is committed to creating a country where every Kenyan has the opportunity to thrive. We believe in empowering young people, giving them the chance to fulfill their political ambitions, and providing them with the tools they need to contribute to the leadership and growth of this great nation.</p>
        
        <!-- Hidden content -->
        <div id="read-more-content" style="display: none;">
            <p>We are committed to ensuring that every Kenyan enjoys the right to quality education, access to good infrastructure, and the opportunity for meaningful employment. The future of our nation depends on how we treat our young people today. We believe that by investing in education, in skills development, and in job creation, we can unlock the full potential of our youth and position them as the leaders of tomorrow.</p>
            <p>The time has come for us to change the direction of our country. Together, we can rid ourselves of the corrupt leaders who have prioritized personal greed and self-interest over the needs of the people. We need leaders who are not driven by selfish motives, but who are truly committed to serving the people and fulfilling their promises. Leaders who hold truth and integrity at the core of their actions. Leaders who will dedicate themselves to the work of building a better, more equitable society for all Kenyans.</p>
            <p>The Renaissance Party stands firm in its fight against the injustices that have plagued our nation for far too long. We will take bold action against corruption, unemployment, extrajudicial killings, abductions, and the crushing burden of over-taxation. We will fight to reverse the high cost of living that continues to hurt ordinary citizens and work towards creating an economy that works for all Kenyans, not just a select few.</p>
            <p>As we look ahead, our focus remains clear: to restore justice and integrity to our political system and create a society where all people, regardless of their background or status, can thrive. We will be vigilant in the fight for the rights of the marginalized, the downtrodden, and the voiceless. We are committed to tackling the deep-rooted challenges facing our nation, and we will not rest until we achieve the fundamental changes that Kenya so desperately needs.</p>
            <p>Before the campaign season begins, we must come together to lay the groundwork for the work ahead. Our party will not just be a political force, but a movement; a movement of change, hope, and progress. We need to engage with the Kenyan people, understand their needs, and show them that we are not just another political party. We are a party that is ready to take on the challenges that lie ahead. We are a party that will fight for the people, with the people, every step of the way.</p>
            <p>But none of this can be achieved without your support. We need you; your ideas, your energy, and your commitment to this cause. Whether it's through membership registration, volunteering your time, or making a donation, your involvement will be the driving force behind the real and lasting change that we are striving for. Together, we can build a movement that will transform Kenya, that will bring about the change we all deserve.</p>
            <p>Let us stand united, shoulder to shoulder, as we move towards a brighter future. With your support, we can create a Kenya that works for everyone, where the principles of justice, equality, and opportunity are not just ideals, but the everyday reality of our citizens.</p>
            <p>Thank you all for your continued dedication to this cause. Let’s build this movement together, and let’s show Kenya that we are ready to face the future, with hope, determination, and integrity.</p>
            <p>Mungu mbele!</p>

    <div id="manifesto-more" style="display: none;">
        <h3>Youth Empowerment and Encouraging Political Participation</h3>
        <p>Kenya’s youth are the future of our nation. However, far too often, young people are sidelined from meaningful opportunities in politics and governance. The Renaissance Party is committed to the empowerment of youth, not just in terms of job opportunities, but also in terms of encouraging active participation in political leadership.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Youth Empowerment and Engagement:</strong> We will create avenues for young people to be actively involved in governance, encouraging them to run for political office at all levels, including in Parliament, County Assemblies, and the Executive. We believe in a youth-driven transformation of Kenya.</li>
            <li><strong>Leadership Training and Mentorship:</strong> We will establish leadership programs to equip young people with the skills necessary to navigate the political system, including governance, public service, diplomacy, and conflict resolution. This will be done through mentorship programs that focus on character-building and leadership ethics.</li>
            <li><strong>Creating Employment for the Youth:</strong> The Renaissance Party recognizes the challenges of youth unemployment and will focus on creating more opportunities through entrepreneurship, skill development, and job creation in key sectors like technology, agriculture, manufacturing, and the service industry.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Justice, Truth, and Integrity</h3>
        <p>The core principles of justice, truth, and integrity are non-negotiable values that will guide all actions of the Renaissance Party.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Eradicating Corruption:</strong> We are committed to tackling corruption at all levels of government. We will create independent anti-corruption bodies with the authority to investigate and prosecute corrupt officials without interference. Public servants will be held to the highest standards of accountability.</li>
            <li><strong>Justice for All:</strong> We will ensure that every Kenyan has access to justice, regardless of their financial or social status. Our justice system will be fair, transparent, and accessible. We will strengthen institutions that safeguard the rule of law and ensure equal rights for all citizens.</li>
            <li><strong>Upholding the Constitution:</strong> The Constitution of Kenya is the foundation of our nation’s democracy. We are committed to upholding it in its entirety and ensuring that all government actions align with its provisions. We will continue to champion the protection of human rights and ensure that the Bill of Rights is respected.</li>
